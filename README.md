# GraphSparsificationResearch

Study of the effect of sparsification on the speed and accuracy of algorithms on graphs.

Use [this](experiments.ipynb) file to run experiments with random sparsifier and PageRank algorithm. There are two types of experiments. The first one is with fixed probability of removing edges and the second one with fixed number of vertices and different probabilities.

To learn more see the [presentation](GraphSparsification.pdf).
